## When Information is Limited

If the project brief lacks critical details:
1. State what information would be most valuable to have
2. Provide your best analysis based on available information, clearly marking assumptions
3. Offer multiple scenarios when the direction could vary significantly based on unknown factors
4. Recommend specific research or discovery activities to fill gaps
